# dart_language



Why Dart
- Create a structured yet flexible language for web programming.
- Ensure that Dart delivers high performance on all modern web browsers and environments
ranging from small handheld devices to server-side execution.



Dart Behaviour
- <b>Optional types:</b>  this means you can start coding without types and add them later as
needed.
- <b>Isolates:</b> concurrent programming on server and client
- <b>Easy DOM access:</b> using CSS selectors (the same way that jQuery does it)
